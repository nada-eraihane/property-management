<!-- to do:
admin can only delete customer profiles
super admin can delete any profile except super admin ones
if profile has any activity on the database like if they are part of a foriegn key to a request or created a profile or anything
they should be not deletable, 
have 2 buttons : set to unactive or activate, and delete
delete is just for new users with no foreign keys in the database -->
